The class `TaskCompletionSource<T>` is quite useful in unit tests on asynchronous calls.
The following assertions helps to check that the result is available within specific time.

```csharp
var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();
await tcs.Should().CompleteWithin(1.Seconds());
```

The assertion returns the result for subsequent value assertions.

```csharp
var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();
await tcs.Should().CompleteWithin(1.Seconds()).WithResult(true);
```

Additionally it is possible to assert that the task will *not* complete within specific time.

```csharp
var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();
await tcs.Should().NotCompleteWithin(1.Seconds());
```
